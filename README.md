# Structural_Analysis_Using_Ansys
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of a beam using ANSYS - includes static structural simulation, total deformation, normal stress, and equivalent (von-Mises) stress results.
This project demonstrates Structural Analysis using ANSYS. The simulation was carried out following a tutorial, with the objective of understanding the workflow of finite element analysis (FEA) in ANSYS.

 Objectives
Learn the process of setting up a static structural simulation in ANSYS.
Analyze Total Deformation, Normal Stress, and Equivalent (von-Mises) Stress for a beam under loading.
Gain hands-on experience in interpreting FEA results.

 Results
Maximum Deformation: 6.81 × 10⁻⁵ m
Maximum Normal Stress: 7.48 × 10⁶ Pa
Maximum Equivalent Stress: 7.01 × 10⁶ Pa
